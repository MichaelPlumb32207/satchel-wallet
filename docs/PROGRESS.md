# Satchel — Progress

Last Updated: 2026-07-17
Version: 0.2.0

## Session Log

### Session 4 — 2026-07-17 — Security & trust + build provenance (ENH-004)

**Context:** Public repo is reviewable; users still need an in-app place that
explains self-custody honestly and ties the live site to a specific commit.

**Shipped:**
- `/security` — Security & trust page (keys-on-device, never-do, threat model,
  open source, this-build commit link). Linked from Settings footer.
- `getBuildInfo` + `next.config` injects `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` /
  `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GIT_*` so production shows a short
  SHA linking to GitHub; local dev shows `dev`.
- USER_GUIDE §8/§13; UC-028; CORE-16 tests.

**Verification:** `npm run verify` this session.

### Session 3 — 2026-07-17 — Progressive balance / scan reassurance (ENH-003)

**Context:** Mainnet cold balance loads feel “stuck” (gap scan of ~40 addresses
on the paced public API). A blank skeleton is panic-inducing when the user
expects coins. Time cost itself is accepted; clarity is not.

**Shipped:**
- Live scan progress (`useScanProgress`) during gap-limit scans: address count
  + provisional balance from address-info (`balanceFromAddressInfo`) with no
  extra API calls.
- Home: “Looking for your coins…” + counter; shows **Balance so far** when
  coins appear mid-scan; import `ScanStep` copy aligned.
- USER_GUIDE §1 restore note + expanded §12 troubleshooting; UC-008 edges;
  MEMORY gotcha. 3 new unit tests for address-info balance math.

**Verification:** `npm test` / `npm run verify` (this session).

**Next:** User smoke on mainnet cold open; FEAT-003 still open for Phase 1.

### Session 2 — 2026-07-03 — Phase 1: faucet button (FEAT-001) + CPFP "Speed up" (FEAT-002)

**Context:** First two Phase 1 items — make Practice mode frictionless and
close the fee-management loop (RBF for your own sends + CPFP for stuck
received payments). Version 0.1.0 → 0.2.0.

**FEAT-001 — "Get free practice coins":**
- `faucetUrl` set to `https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet4/` (re-verified live
  today; it paid out during the v1 smoke test). No prefill query param exists,
  so tapping the button copies the current receive address to the clipboard
  and shows "Address copied — paste it on the faucet page."
- Mainnet shows no faucet UI (verified in-browser).

**FEAT-002 — CPFP "Speed up":**
- New pure planner `src/lib/wallet/cpfp.ts` (`planCpfp`): spends all our
  outputs of the pending parent to our own next change address, with
  `child_fee = target × (parent_vsize + child_vsize) − parent_fee`, floored at
  the child's own 1 sat/vB relay minimum; tops up from confirmed/own-change
  coins when the anchor can't cover the boost (never others' unconfirmed).
  The deliberate exception to the "don't spend unconfirmed receives" rule.
- `SpeedUpDialog` (jargon-free copy, fast-rate default, package-rate preview,
  "boost dies harmlessly if the sender cancels" note); "Speed up" pill on
  pending incoming txs in History while their output is still in the UTXO set.
  Shared `nextFreeChangeIndex` exported from `bump.ts`.
- 11 new unit tests (`cpfp.test.ts`): package math, change-address targeting,
  multi-output anchors, top-ups, trust rule, relay floor, all error paths.

**Also:** marked ENH-001 deployed (it shipped with the v1 push — the
"pending deploy" note was stale).

**Verification:** 105 tests green (94 → 105); `npm run verify` passes.
In-browser (dev server): Practice-mode receive shows the faucet button +
copied-hint on tap and correct href; mainnet hides it; History renders with
zero console errors. **Not yet live-tested:** an actual CPFP broadcast needs a
pending incoming testnet payment — part of the user's next smoke test.

**Next session priorities:**
- User smoke test on deploy: faucet coins → send → RBF bump → CPFP speed-up
  (docs/testnet-checklist.md).
- FEAT-003 (throwaway practice wallet) to finish Phase 1.

### Session 1 — 2026-07-02 → 2026-07-03 — Full rewrite of bitpoc-ui → Satchel, ship & deploy

**Context:** Ground-up rewrite of the `bitpoc-ui` proof of concept (deprecated
CRA tooling, unencrypted seed, change-to-receive-address privacy bug) into a
security-first, self-custodial Bitcoin PWA people will actually use.

**Infrastructure:**
- `create-next-app` (Next.js 16, TS, Tailwind v4, App Router, src dir, Turbopack)
- Crypto stack: `@scure/bip39` + `@scure/bip32` + `@scure/btc-signer` +
  `@noble/*` + `@scure/base` — audited, pure-ESM, no Node polyfills
- State: Zustand + TanStack Query; storage: idb-keyval (IndexedDB)
- GitHub repo (public): MichaelPlumb32207/satchel-wallet
- Vercel project `satchel-wallet` (team Liberty Concierge), auto-deploy from `main`
- **No backend, no database, no env vars** — only external dep is the public
  mempool.space REST API (keyless)

**Milestones delivered (M1–M6):**
- **M1 — Crypto core:** mnemonic, BIP84/86 derivation (external + internal
  change chains, fixing the POC bug), address validation, SLIP-132, BIP21,
  per-script-type fee/vsize tables, effective-value coin selection. 66 tests
  vs published BIP vectors.
- **M2 — Vault + session:** scrypt (N=2¹⁶) + AES-256-GCM vault in IndexedDB;
  keys held only in a module-closure keyring, wiped on lock; auto-lock on
  idle/tab-hide/page-hide; LockGate unmounts wallet UI when locked.
- **M3 — Onboarding + receive:** create / import-seed / import-watch-only
  flows; password-gated seed reveal + 3-word verification quiz; mempool.space
  client (concurrency-capped, retrying); gap-limit restore scanner; receive
  page (QR, BIP21, address rotation).
- **M4 — Dashboard + explorer:** balance (BTC/sats + fiat), classified tx
  history, slim tx/address explorer pages, watch-only read path (viewable
  while locked), network switch + practice-mode theming, wallet switcher.
- **M5 — Send + RBF:** 3-step send (recipient validation w/ network-mismatch,
  BIP21, QR scan, fee presets + custom, MAX), PSBT build/sign/broadcast,
  RBF fee-bump dialog with BIP125 floor enforcement.
- **M6 — PWA + polish:** settings (network/display/security/danger zone, xpub
  export), manifest + hand-rolled app-shell service worker, TanStack Query
  offline persister, strict CSP + security headers.

**Post-deploy (smoke test):**
- ENH-001: added the network/Practice toggle to onboarding (it only existed in
  the post-onboarding shell, so newcomers couldn't reach Practice mode).
  Fixed + verified locally; **committed, pending deploy.**

**Verification:**
- 94 unit tests green; `npm run verify` (typecheck/lint/test/build) passes.
- In-browser: create/unlock/lock, receive on both networks, backup quiz,
  watch-only import, live tx detail page, real testnet4 faucet receive
  (coinfaucet.eu) confirmed on the deployed site.

**Status:** LIVE at satchel-wallet.vercel.app. Core wallet functional on
mainnet + testnet4.

**Docs (ENH-002):** merged `TEST_PLAN.md` into `USE_CASE_CATALOG.md` — each use
case now carries its own verification (happy path + edge cases), with a shared
"Automated core coverage" table for the pure-lib suites. Living-docs set is now
**eight** (was nine); adopted as the cross-project standard.

**Next session priorities:**
- Push ENH-001 (onboarding toggle) to deploy.
- User completes the testnet4 send + fee-bump smoke test (needs faucet coins).
- FEAT-001 (faucet button), then FEAT-002 (CPFP "Speed up").
